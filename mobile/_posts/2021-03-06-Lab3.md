# Welcome - Lab 3
## Prerequisites 
* Android Studio
* Emulator
* APKtool
* Sign tool
* Jadx
* (all mentioned in slides)

## Goal
2 types of challenges, first two will be decompile challenges, last one will be a recompile challenge.

## Lab 3

### Challenge 1
* Use Lab01.apk which can be found on Leho
* Use __APKtool__ to find a flag in the code

**Solution:**
* Download APKtool
* Optional: set the environment path for APKtool
* run APKtool: `apktool d lab01.apk` (d = decompile)
* go to the directory lab01
* look into the res/values folder
* open the strings.xml file
* look for all "odd" strings
* you can find `flaglab01` xml key and its value there






### Challenge 2
* Use Lab02.apk which can be found on Leho
* Use __Jadx__ to find a flag in the code

**Solution:**
* Download jadx-gui
* open jadx-gui and open lab02.apk
* in the code, you can find a hardcoded string
* com.example.lab2 -> MainActivity    
   



  
### Challenge 3
* Use Lab01.apk
* Decompile use APKtool
* Change the name of the app to "Lab01Pwned"
* Recompile the APK
* (Don't forget to sign 😀)

**Solution:**
* open the lab01 decompiled directory (see challenge 1)
* go to values/strings.xml 
* change the value of <string name="app_name">Lab01</string>
* Use apktool to build 
* `apktool b lab01/`
* if it fails, use aapt2 
* `apktool b lab01/ --use-aapt2`



### (optional) Challenge 4
* Go to Intigriti, Hackerone, Bugcrowd
* Pick a program you like
* Decompile the app, look for something interesting 
    * API keys
    * HTTP endpoints
    * Odd urls
* If you think you found something interesting, you can either submit it to the platform or show me and I'll try to help out
* (Every bounty over 10K has to buy a round of beers for the ppl in the class?)
